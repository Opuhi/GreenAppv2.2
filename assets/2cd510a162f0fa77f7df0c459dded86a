     "title_one_text_seven" : "Like all social networks and dating sites, we are faced with attempts of intrusion by fraudulent profiles that practice what is called \"sentimental scaming\". These are profiles that look more than perfect at first glance (a little too much to be true) and that seduce you in record time for the sole purpose of extracting money.\n\nWe try our best to prevent the presence of these fake profiles on the site by manual validation of each registration, but they are sometimes difficult to identify at first, so the help of our members is precious and we act immediately as soon as a profile is reported to us.\n\nIn any case, we strongly advise you to never share your contact details to a person you have just met on the internet, this is why email addresses are automatically detected and deleted in the messages. We recommend you to organize a meeting in person using the messaging platform on GreenLovers and then exchange your contact information during this meeting if you wish. Besides, a fraudulent profile will certainly never show up at a real meeting ...\n\nBut in general, the messages too good to be true from the first exchanges, the immediate transmission of a private email to communicate outside the platform, the sudden occurrence of a problem abroad requiring your support and financial help, pictures of perfect men or women (who are obviously usurped), are warning signals of potential fraud.\n\nIt's not about being alarmed or seeing the evil everywhere, but just staying alert and listening to your instinct. In any case, if you have any doubt about a user registered on GreenLovers, we invite you to use the function \"Report to moderation\" available on each profile.",
